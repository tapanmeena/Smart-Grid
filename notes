A simple structure of a synchrophasor network consists of the PMU and PDC as shown in Figure 2. If
multiple intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) in a substation provide synchrophasor measurements, a local
PDC may be deployed in the substation. Typically, many PMUs located at various key substations gather
data and send it in real time to a PDC at the utility location where the data is aggregated. The data collected
by PDCs may be used to support many applications, ranging from visualization of information and alarms
for situational awareness, to ones that provide sophisticated analytical, control, or protection functionality.
Applications, such as dynamics monitoring, use full-resolution real-time data along with grid models to
support both operating and planning functions. The application displays locally measured frequency, primary voltages, currents, real and reactive power flows, and other quantities for system operators. Many
PDCs belonging to different utilities can be connected to a common central PDC to aggregate data across
the utilities, in order to provide an interconnection-wide snapshot of the power grid measurements.
